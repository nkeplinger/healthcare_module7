## WELCOME
Welcome to our team project reapo for module 7. We have decided to analyze an open source dataset that has captured staff shortages among hospitals across the country from Jan 2020 through Desember 2022 along with additional metadata. Our goal was to rearch possible commonalities and trends among staff shortages and other hospital data. 

## Repo Architecture
#Source Data
Source data was pulled from https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh
There is an available API, but we grabbed the data as a CSV for ease of importaing and version control. 
This file is located in `Resources/COVID_staff_shortages.csv`

### Individual project code
Individually we all decided to tackle a research questions and work through a personalized Jupiter Notebook. These individual pieces are located in `group_working_code/`. There are 4 files, one for each team member to work with.

### Final Code
Our final code has been merged together into a final file `final_data_analysis_and_vizualization.ipnb`. This file consists of all merge code from individual group members to generate all the data analysis and supporting visuals 

### Supporting Images 
All supporting images were output and saved in the `output/` directory. These ouptputs were used to generate our final report summary and presentation. Figure numbers correspond to the reasearch topic they are supporting. 

## Research Summary
We Broke our data into four research topics to better uncover trends associated with staff shortages in hospitals from 2020 to 2022. After initial data exploration we each developed hypotheses to test:

### Topic 1: (Dylan) 

### Topic 2: (Raelle)

### Topic 3: (Nicolette) Staff shortages Vs. Adult and Pediatric Patient Numbers

Null 3.1: here is no relationship between staff shortages and inpatient occupancy (Adult and/or Pediatric) from 2020 to 2022 in the US
Alternative 3.1: There is a relationship between critical staff shortages and adult and/or pediatric inpatient occupancy from 2020 to 2022
__Result Summary:__ 

Null 3.2: There is no relationship between staff shortages and confirmed covid cases (Adult and/or Pediatric) from 2020 to 2022 in the US
Alternative 3.2:There is a relationship between critical staff shortages and confirmed covid cases in adult and/or pediatrics from 2020 to 2022
__Result Summary:__


### Topic 4: (Iqra)




## Thanks from the team :)
