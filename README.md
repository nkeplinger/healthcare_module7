Question 1 (Dylan): How does time of year/ days/month impact shortage? Are there temporal trends?

Questions 2 (Raelle): How does reported death affect hospital shortage? Or vice versa? 
  The day before a death is there a shortage spike, or day after? No change?

Question 3 (Nicolette): Are there difference in shortages when pediatric patient count is high (or low)? Same for Adult?
  Regression trends with pediatric and shortage? Adult and Shortage?
  Does one follow another?
  Do these spike (or dips) occur at the same time?

Question 4 (Iqra): Shortage trend/impacts/correlations with size of states? Number of hospitals? Geographic location?
  Do more hospitals mean more shortages?

Challenge if it pops up: flu versus covid/diagnosis/misdiagnoses?
